                                <p>One reason individuals choose online learning is so that they can earn a certificate or degree entirely online without traveling to a college campus or attending classes at fixed times. In addition, certificates and degrees that are conferred do not typically designate whether the student earned them through an online program or not. </p>
								<p>Another option is a hybrid program, which either combines on-campus and online classes or offers a fully online curriculum that requires some visits to the school for orientation, seminars or hands-on training. Some classes can also be taken independently for personal enrichment, without enrolling in a complete program or being formally admitted to the host school. </p>

In addition, some classes follow a fixed semester schedule; others have no definitive end date. Options are available for working adults who wish to pace themselves slowly through a degree program as well as for driven students who wish to complete a degree program in a fraction of the time normally required. </p>

                                <p>Many online classes also require students to spend a certain amount of time interacting with the professor, posting on message boards or working on group projects with fellow students.

                                <p>Because of the self-directed nature of online learning, students may be held to higher levels of accountability for time management, motivation and written communication. Since they can't simply speak up as they would in a classroom, they need to be able to voice concerns, ask questions and submit work in writing. It's ultimately up to individuals to determine if online learning is right for them, and many schools offer online learning orientation or quizzes to help candidates decide if this option is suitable.</p>
